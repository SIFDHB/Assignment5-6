- FUNCTION -

Function EuclideanAlgorithm(a, b): #1
    While (b is not 0), do: #2
        New variable "temp", Set temp to [b] #3
        Set b to [a mod b] (aka [a % b]) #4
        Set a to temp #5
    End While
    Return a #6
End Function

- NUMBERED COMMENTS -

#1 - EuclideanAlgorithm takes two values (a and b) as input.
#2 - The loop iterates as long as b is not equal to zero. At which point the value 'a' will hold the greatest common divisor (GCD).
#3 - A temporary variable temp is used to store the value of b.
#4 - Update b to be the remainder of the division of a by b.
#5 - Update a to be the previous value of b. This shifts the numbers down for the next iteration.
#6 - Once b becomes zero, the loop exits. and the function returns a which holds the greatest common divisor.
