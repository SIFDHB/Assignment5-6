    End If

    (gcd, x1, y1) = ExtendedEuclideanAlgorithm(b, a mod b) #4

- NUMBERED COMMENTS -
#1 - ExtendedEuclideanAlgorithm takes two values (a and b) as input and also calculates the coefficients x and y.
#2 - Checks if b is 0. If b is 0, the algorithm reaches its base case.
#3 - Returns a tuple of (a, 1, 0) when b is 0.
#4 - Makes a recursive call to ExtendedEuclideanAlgorithm with b and a mod b as parameters.
#5 - Sets x to the value of y1 from the recursive call, following the back substitution method to calculate the new x coefficient.
#6 - Calculates the new y coefficient using the formula y = x1 - (a div b) * y1.
#7 - Returns a tuple containing the GCD of a and b, along with the coefficients x and y.
